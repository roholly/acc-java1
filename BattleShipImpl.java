	 * Write a BattleShip class that uses 10 arrays (y0 – y9) of 10 elements each. 
	 * 
	 * Hide (2) ships by generating two random starting locations (x,y) where 
	 *   y is the array and x is the element in that array. 
	 *   Generate another random for the ship size which can be from 1 to 10. 
	 *   Do not reveal ship locations to user.
	 *   
	 * Game play: allow user to enter (x,y) coordinates using Scanner 
	 *   class and if it “hits” a ship print “hit”, else print “miss”. 
	 *   When all coordinates of ship are hit print “sunk”. 
	 *   When both ships sunk say “game over, you took “ <count> “ tries 
	 *   to sink ships”. 
	 *   
	 * Version 2.0: convert the 10 arrays to a single two dimensional array
